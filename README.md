# fastpbkdf2
This is a fast PBKDF2-HMAC-{SHA1,SHA256,SHA512} implementation in C.

It uses OpenSSL's hash functions, but out-performs OpenSSL's own PBKDF2
thanks to [various optimisations in the inner loop](https://jbp.io/2015/08/11/pbkdf2-performance-matters.html#strategies).

## Interface

```c
void fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha1(const uint8_t *pw, size_t npw,
                          const uint8_t *salt, size_t nsalt,
                          uint32_t iterations,
                          uint8_t *out, size_t nout);

void fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha256(const uint8_t *pw, size_t npw,
                            const uint8_t *salt, size_t nsalt,
                            uint32_t iterations,
                            uint8_t *out, size_t nout);

void fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha512(const uint8_t *pw, size_t npw,
                            const uint8_t *salt, size_t nsalt,
                            uint32_t iterations,
                            uint8_t *out, size_t nout);
```

## Performance

These values are wall time, output from the `bench` tool.

## Requirements
* OpenSSL's libcrypto.
* C compiler supporting C99.

## Building and testing
Run 'make test' to build and run tests.

The program `bench` provides a very basic performance comparison between OpenSSL and fastpbkdf2.

The implementation has one header and one translation unit.  This
is intended for easy integration into your project.

### Optional parallelisation of outer loop
PBKDF2 is misdesigned and you should avoid asking for more than your hash function's output length.
In other words, nout should be <= 20 for `fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha1`, <= 32 for `fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha256`
and <= 64 for `fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha512`.

If you can't avoid this (for compatibility reasons, say) compile everything with `-fopenmp`
and `-DWITH_OPENMP` to have this computation done in parallel.  Note that this has non-zero
overhead.

The program `multibench` provides a basic performance comparison for using this option.
